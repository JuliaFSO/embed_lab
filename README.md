🤖 Introduction
===============

This repository contains a Colab notebook that showcases the power of Generative AI in a practical use case. The notebook demonstrates how to use the Genai API to embed and search through a set of documents, and how to rephrase statements using a generative model.

📚 The Code
==========

The notebook is divided into three main sections:

- **Embedding and Searching Documents**: This section demonstrates how to embed documents using the Genai API and how to search through the embedded documents using a query.
- **Applying the Generative Model**: This section shows how to use the generative model to rephrase a given statement.
- **Running the Code**: This section provides instructions on how to run the code in Colab.

🔧 Setup
=======

To run the code, you will need to have a Genai API key. You can obtain a key by following the instructions in the Genai documentation.

Once you have the key, you can set it up in Colab by running the following command:
```python
!genai configure-api-key <YOUR_API_KEY>
```
📝 The Documents
===============

The notebook uses three documents that describe different features of a Google car:

- Operating the Climate Control System
- Touchscreen
- Shifting Gears

🔍 The Query
==========

The query used in the notebook is:
```python
query = 'How do I shift gear on a google car?'
```
🤖 The Generative Model
======================
The notebook uses the gemini-1.0-pro generative model to rephrase the statement.

💻 Running the Code
==================
To run the code, simply open the Colab notebook and follow the instructions.

📝 Conclusion
============
This notebook provides a practical example of how to use Generative AI to embed, search, and rephrase documents. By following the steps in the notebook, you can learn how to use the Genai API and the generative model to build your own AI-powered applications.

💻 Next Steps
=============
Now that you have seen the power of Generative AI, why not try building your own AI-powered application? You can start by modifying the code in the notebook to embed, search, and rephrase your own set of documents.

Happy coding! 🚀
